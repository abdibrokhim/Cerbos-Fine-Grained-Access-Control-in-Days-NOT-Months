# Cerbos: Fine-Grained Access Control in Days NOT Months

Recently I came across a new open-source project called `Cerbos: Authorization-as-a-Service`. It worth to discuss it here.

## So... What is Cerbos?

*In a very brief:* 

[Cerbos](https://www.cerbos.dev/) is an authorization solution, which helps developers easily implement and manage fine-grained access control. 
As of November 2024, Cerbos is still in the early stages of development, but it already looks promising.

They offer two main products such as [Cerbos Hub](https://www.cerbos.dev/product-cerbos-hub) and [Cerbos Policy Decision Point (PDP)](https://www.cerbos.dev/product-cerbos-pdp).
It's kinda one solution for different teams like [Developers](https://www.cerbos.dev/for-developers), [Architects](https://www.cerbos.dev/for-architects), [Security Engineers](https://www.cerbos.dev/for-security-teams), and [Product Teams](https://www.cerbos.dev/for-product-teams) to implement authorization in their applications.

Let's dive into the details. And see how different teams can benefit from Cerbos.

## Cerbos Hub: 

### Cerbos for Developers: Why Developers Love Cerbos?

Authorization can be a complex, time-consuming task for developers. But with **Cerbos**, you can simplify your workflow and focus on building amazing features instead of wrestling with access controls.  

#### **Implement Authorization Once**  

Want to see how easy it is? Check out the [Cerbos video tutorial](https://youtu.be/caqUh6i3vVQ) to learn how to add a typical `CRUD policy` to a simple Express app in Node.

#### **Developer-Centric Design**  
Cerbos is built by developers, for developers. It's designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing infrastructure, no matter how you deploy:  
- Host it as a **`sidecar`**, **`service`**, or **`function`**.  
- Define permissions as **`config files`** outside your application logic‚Äîno more code changes when access requirements evolve.  

#### **Production-Ready from Day One**  
With Cerbos, you don't need to worry about last-minute surprises in production. Enjoy first-class support for **`GitOps`** with features like:  
- A **built-in testing framework** to validate policies.  
- Easy integration with your **`CI/CD pipeline`** for seamless deployment.

#### **Support for Multiple Languages**  
Cerbos is designed for flexibility, with support for popular programming languages like:  
- **.NET, Go, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and Rust**  
And that's just the start‚Äîmore languages are on the way!

#### **One-Line Authorization Made Simple**  
Cerbos takes the hassle out of authorization with an intuitive approach that reduces boilerplate and keeps your code clean. Here's a simple example in Rust:

*before Cerbos:*
    
```rust
if user.email.ends_with("@mycompany.com") !! (user.company.package == "premium" && user.groups.any(|&g| g == "managers")) 
{
    if user.region = resource.region {
        audit_log. record(audit::ALLOWED, "edit", user, resource);
        // access allowed
    } else {
        audit_log.record(audit::DENIED, "edit", user, resource)
        // access denied
    } 
} else {
    audit_log. record(audit:: DENIED, "edit", user, resource)
    // access denied
}
```

*after Cerbos:*

```rust
if cerbos_client.is_allowed("edit", user, rosource, None).await? 
{
    // access allowed
}
```
Say goodbye to scattered, complex authorization logic. With Cerbos, you make a single call for access decisions. From there, product owners or security teams can manage access rules without ever touching your code.  

With Cerbos, authorization is no longer a bottleneck. It's a streamlined, developer-friendly process that empowers you to build faster, scale easily, and stay secure. [Try it out today](https://www.cerbos.dev/) !
